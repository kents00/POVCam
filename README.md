"Adds a camera based on the current point of view”

## Introduction

Adding a camera and adjusting it to your needs can be time-consuming, which is the reason I created this addon to make it easier to add a camera. It allows the user to add a new camera object to the scene, make it the active camera, and adjust its position and orientation to match the current point of view in the active 3D viewport.
